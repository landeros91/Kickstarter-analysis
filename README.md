# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter data set, the appropriate data was gathered and filtered to put together visuals including pivot charts and line graphs. With the charts in place I have a numerical and graph visual that shows success,failed, cancelled and grand total per campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Using the Kiskstarter sheet,I created a new column labeled "years" were I extracted the year from "Date Created Conversion". Second, I created a pivot table in a new sheet labled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Dates. Finally, filtered; successful, failed and cancelled for theater in descending order.

###### Analysis shows the following:
- April through July show a higher successful theater launch dates.
- In August the successful launch date dipped down to 72, leading to further dip.
- December both successful and failed launch date outcomes were off by 2 points.
 Please see visual for overview.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Gathered data from Kickstarter sheet to a new sheet labled "Outcomes Based on Goals". The Goals represent the dollar-amount range so projects can be grouped based on amount.
 In this sheet the following columns were created.
- Goal
- Number Successful
- Number Failed
- Number Canceled
- Total Projects
- Percentage Successful
- Percentage Failed
- Percentage Canceled

###### Analysis shows the following:
- Line chart shows that Percentage Failed started to increase from 4999 to 29999 reaching 80%.
- Percentage Successful had an increase from 30000 to 39999 reaching 67%.
- Percentage Failed highs were at 45000 to 49999 reaching a value at 100%
- Percentage Successful dipped dramitically 4500 to 49999 value at 0%

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge and difficulties were getting the functions correct from the beginning. If the fucntions were not correct, it throws of the final conclusion. It took roughly 2 hours for me to get the criteria and range correct in order for the functions to work. When I figured it out, it was trully successful! 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. April through July show a higher successful theater launch dates.
  2. In August the successful launch date dipped down to 72, leading to further dip.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1. Line chart shows that Percentage Failed started to increase from 4999 to 29999 reaching 80%.
  2. Percentage Failed was more prominent in overall success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
It would have been more impactful to have data to have how many attended and consumer feedback.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
WE could created stacked cluster columns to see how performance is matched.
